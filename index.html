    <h2>To {NAME},</h2>

    <p>
        I don’t know when exactly it started.
        Maybe it was your vibe.
        Maybe it was your energy.
        But somewhere between small conversations,
        you became different.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not just someone I talk to.
        Not just someone I admire.
        You started feeling like my type.
        My frequency.
        My calm in the chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m not here to rush anything.
        I’m not here to force emotions.
        I’m here because what I feel is real.
        And I don’t ignore real things.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you feel even a little of this too…
        I want to build something intentional.
        Something meaningful.
        Something lasting.
    </p>
